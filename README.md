# KLZ_AS_analysis
We sampled anal swabs at consecutive time points for patients in the KLZ trial and performed metagenomic sequencing. Here we provide all the code and pipline used to analyze the data in the article. The order of all the code is determined by the order of the figures in the article, and is presented in R markdown.
